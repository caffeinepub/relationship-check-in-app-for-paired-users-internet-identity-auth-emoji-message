  "summary": "Premium flag and status query appear implemented on backend (with migration) and consumed on frontend via a new React Query hook; frontend composer and Today’s Status UI were updated to handle premium gating and multiple check-ins display. However, evidence is insufficient in the provided diff summary to confirm backend enforcement of the 1/day limit for free users and query invalidation behavior after additional premium submissions.",

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Update backend check-in submission rules so free users can submit at most 1 check-in per day, while premium users can submit multiple check-ins per day.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for backend/main.mo is truncated before any submitCheckIn logic; no shown changes demonstrate enforcing a 1/day limit for non-premium users or allowing multiple submissions for premium users with a clear rejection message for the second free submission.",

      "requirement": "Submitting an additional premium check-in invalidates today/history queries and the UI updates accordingly.",
      "reason": "While the composer now blocks non-premium users and uses a new premium-status query hook, the diff summary shows no modifications to the submit mutation hook (useSubmitCheckIn) or any explicit invalidation of today/history queries on success; therefore this AC cannot be confirmed from the provided diff.",
